# Breast Cancer Prediction Model using Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains a breast cancer prediction model implemented using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The model is designed to classify breast cancer instances as either malignant or benign based on a set of features. SVM is a robust machine learning algorithm well-suited for binary classification tasks.

## Dataset

The model utilizes the Breast Cancer Dataset, which is included in the repository. The dataset consists of features computed from a digitized image of a breast mass's fine needle aspirate (FNA).

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:

- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
