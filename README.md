## 🔴 Welcome contributors!
Machine learning is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain—albeit far from matching its ability—allowing it to “learn” from large amounts of data. Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. The concept of deep learning is not new. It has been around for a couple of years now. It’s on hype nowadays because earlier we did not have that much processing power and a lot of data. As in the last 20 years, the processing power has increased exponentially, deep learning and machine learning have come into the picture. </br> </br>

## Structure of the Projects 📝
This repository consists of various machine learning projects, and all of the projects must follow a certain template. I hope the contributors will take care of this while contributing in this repository. <br><br>
**Dataset** - This folder stores the dataset used in this project. If the Dataset is not able to upload in this folder due to the large size, then put a README.md file inside the Dataset folder and put the link of the collected dataset in it. That'll work!<br><br>
**Images** - This folder is used to store the images generated during the data analysis, data visualization, and data segmentation of the project.<br><br>
**Model** - This folder would have your project file (that is .ipynb file) be it analysis or prediction.
