# Brain Tumor Detection

Brain tumors represent abnormal growths of cells within the brain, posing significant health risks. Early and accurate detection is critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes.
The model works on advanced algorithm of VGG-16 to determine if tumor is present or not in the given brain image.
The application of binary classification facilitates efficient training, enabling the model to distinguish between tumor and non-tumor regions in the brain images.
The study includes the optimization and comparison of model loss functions, as well as the evaluation of performance metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall.
